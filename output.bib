Hypothesis (CH) holds, \textbf{all} Denjoy-Carleman classes carry sparse

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {math.CT},
Abstract      = {The Grothendieck construction establishes an equivalence between fibrations,
a.k.a. fibred categories, and indexed categories, and is one of the fundamental
results of category theory. Cockett and Cruttwell introduced the notion of
fibrations in the context of tangent categories and proved that the fibres of a
tangent fibration inherit a tangent structure from the total tangent category.
The main goal of this paper is to provide a Grothendieck construction for
tangent fibrations. Our first attempt will focus on providing a correspondence
between tangent fibrations and indexed tangent categories, which are
collections of tangent categories and tangent morphisms indexed by the objects
and morphisms of a base tangent category. We will show that this construction
inverts Cockett and Cruttwell's result but it does not provide a full
equivalence between these two concepts. In order to understand how to define a
genuine Grothendieck equivalence in the context of tangent categories, we
introduce a new concept: the formal notion of tangent objects. Tangent objects
play a similar role in tangent category theory as formal monads for monad
theory. We show that tangent fibrations arise as tangent objects of a suitable
$2$-category and we employ this characterization to lift the Grothendieck
construction between fibrations and indexed categories to a genuine
Grothendieck equivalence between tangent fibrations and tangent indexed
categories.},

Abstract      = {We introduce Displayed Type Theory (dTT), a multi-modal homotopy type theory
with discrete and simplicial modes. In the intended semantics, the discrete
mode is interpreted by a model for an arbitrary $\infty$-topos, while the
simplicial mode is interpreted by Reedy fibrant augmented semi-simplicial
diagrams in that model. This simplicial structure is represented inside the
theory by a primitive notion of display or dependency, guarded by modalities,
yielding a partially-internal form of unary parametricity.
  Using the display primitive, we then give a coinductive definition, at the
simplicial mode, of a type $\mathsf{SST}$ of semi-simplicial types. Roughly
speaking, a semi-simplicial type $X$ consists of a type $X_0$ together with,
for each $x:X_0$, a displayed semi-simplicial type over $X$. This mimics how
simplices can be generated geometrically through repeated cones, and is made
possible by the display primitive at the simplicial mode. The discrete part of
$\mathsf{SST}$ then yields the usual infinite indexed definition of
semi-simplicial types, both semantically and syntactically. Thus, dTT enables
working with semi-simplicial types in full semantic generality.},

are fullfilled, such categories coincide with the category of elements
$\int_\mathbf{G} S$ for the group action $S \colon \mathbf{G} \to
\mathbf{Sets}$ implied by the GIS structure. By focusing on the role played by
categories of elements in such a context, we reformulate previous definitions
of transformational networks in a $\mathbf{Cat}$-based diagrammatical
perspective, and present a new definition of transformational networks (called
CT-Nets) in general musical categories. We show incidently how such an approach
provides a bridge between algebraic, geometrical and graph-theoretical
approaches in transformational music analysis. We end with a discussion on the
new perspectives opened by such a formalization of transformational theory, in
particular with respect to $\mathbf{Rel}$-based transformational networks which
occur in well-known music-theoretical constructions such as Douthett's and
Steinbach's Cube Dance.},

Abstract      = {The notion of abelian category is an elegant distillation of the fundamental
properties of the category of abelian groups, comprising a few simple axioms
about products and kernels. Whilst the categories of real, complex, and
quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps are not abelian, they
satisfy almost all of the axioms. Heunen's notion of Hilbert category is an
attempt at adapting the abelian-category axioms to capture instead the essence
of these categories of Hilbert spaces. The key idea is to encode adjoints with
a dagger: an identity-on-objects involutive contravariant endofunctor. One
limitation is the symmetric monoidal structure, which is used to construct
additive inverses of morphisms; such additional structure is not needed for the
analagous result about abelian categories, and it excludes non-commutative
examples like the dagger category of quaternionic Hilbert spaces.
  This article introduces the notion of rational dagger category, a successor
to the notion of Hilbert category whose theory is closer to that of abelian
categories. In particular, a monoidal product is not required. They are named
for their enrichment in the category of rational vector spaces. Whilst the
dagger categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces are the
motivating examples, others include the dagger categories of finite-dimensional
inner-product modules over a partially semiordered involutive division ring and
of self-dual Hilbert modules over a W*-algebra. Also introduced are the notion
of orthogonally complemented dagger category, whose axioms capture the
connection between orthogonal complements and coproducts, and generalisations
of the notions of dagger monomorphism and dagger product, called dagger section
and orthogonal product, which play an important role in the theory of both
orthogonally complemented and rational dagger categories.},
